forEach():
Usage: Iterates over an array and performs a specified task on each element.
Functionality: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
Return Value: undefined. It does not return a new array; instead, 
it modifies the original array (or iterates through it without modifying it, 
depending on the function used within forEach).

Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array.forEach((element) => {
  console.log(element * 2); // Doubles each element but doesn't create a new array
});

map():
Usage: Creates a new array by calling a provided function on every element in the array.
Functionality: Iterates over each array element 
and creates a new array based on the return value of the provided function.
Return Value: Returns a new array with the results of the function
 for each array element without mutating the original array.

Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const newArray = array.map((element) => {
  return element * 2; // Creates a new array with elements doubled
});

find():
Usage: Returns the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function.
Functionality: Searches the array based on a condition and returns 
the first element that meets that condition.
Return Value: Returns the first element that satisfies the condition provided in 
the function or undefined if no element satisfies the condition.

Example:
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const foundElement = array.find((element) => {
  return element > 2; // Finds the first element greater than 2
});

In summary:
1.forEach() is used for executing a function on each element of an array without creating a new array.
2.map() is used for creating a new array by applying a function to each element of an array.
3.find() is used for retrieving the first element in an array that satisfies a provided condition.
